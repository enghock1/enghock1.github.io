I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Oncodea](https://oncodea.com), where I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and oncology. My current focus is developing machine learning systems that detect bio-molecular signatures of early-stage cancers in patient blood samples, aiming to improve survival outcomes through proactive, non-invasive diagnostics.

I hold a PhD in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. My doctoral research was conducted under the supervision of Professor [Vladimir Cherkassky](https://cse.umn.edu/ece/vladimir-cherkassky) and Professor [Tony Low](https://tonylow.umn.edu), and I also gained additional industrial experience through research internships at [TSMC](https://www.tsmc.com/english) and [Astrin Biosciences](https://astrinbio.com).

My research interests lie at bridging the artificial intelligence and the physical sciences, where I focus on advancing the foundations of machine learning to address complex challenges in scientific discovery and engineering design. Key topics I have worked on include:

* Detection of subtle cancer signatures in patient blood samples using advanced ML methods.
* Acceleration of vdW heterostructure materials discovery through the integration of physics knowledge and ML methods.
* Analysis of the double descent phenomenon and generalization capabilities of large over-parameterized ML models using Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory.
* Throughput enhancement by optimizing the multilayer mirrors in the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems.
